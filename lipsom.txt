Liposomes were first described by British haematologist Alec D Bangham[6][7][8] in 1961 (published 1964), at the Babraham Institute, 
in Cambridge. They were discovered when Bangham and R. W. Horne were testing the institute's new electron microscope by adding negative
stain to dry phospholipids. The resemblance to the plasmalemma was obvious,
and the microscope pictures served as the first evidence for the cell membrane being a bilayer lipid structure.
